[DeepSA](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00771-3) can predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds.

DeepSA has a high early enrichment rate for difficult to synthesize compounds and is significantly outperforming other existing methods. DeepSA is currently available online through the [*Bailab website*](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa). This work was done jointly by Lin Wang and me.
