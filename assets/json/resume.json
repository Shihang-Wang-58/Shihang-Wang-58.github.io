By leveraging the rich information embedded in cell images, PhenoModel significantly improves performance in various drug discovery tasks, particularly in virtual screening. Based on PhenoModel, we developed an active compound screening pipeline called PhenoScreen to further screen other molecules with similar activities but novel scaffolds according to the known active compounds."

This helps users to select less expensive molecules for synthesis, thus reducing the time for drug discovery and development.
